## wEasy (Wicket Easy) Enhancement
This is a fork of **wEasy** https://github.com/vitfo/wEasy - a simple CMS (Content Management System) written in Java using the [Apache Wicket framework!](http://wicket.apache.org/) with some enahancements.

## Getting Started

The wEasy project's original purpose is to allow practicing on Apache Wicket development creating simple CMS web application (see https://github.com/vitfo/wEasy for original source).
The application can be used for creating and managing simple web pages then. See http://fungisoft.cz web pages as an example.

Following are enhancements added to the original project:

 Backend:
  - DAO level changed from JDBC to JPA Hibernate with some new DB entities and methods
  - user authentiation added
  - new DB tables added
  - Service level added
  
 Frontend (Wicket):
  - Contact message form added,
  - list of Categories added.
  - Registration form extension
  - logged-in user label added
  
 Unit tests for testing work with DB.

Further possible enhancements:

- https support on Login page
- UI for deleting selected Article, Category and Directory


Basic steps to make app. runnig: 

- import like git project from GitHub into your IDE.
- create DB and configure DB connection.
- run on local IDE Tomcat server or using Maven build ... goal jetty:run

see Installing paragraph for details.


### Prerequisites

Java 8 installed, Maven, created PostgreSQL DB, Tomcat 8.5 installed within IDE.

### Installing

Importing project from Github:
- in Eclipse go to File/Import/Git/Projects from Git, click Next. Select Clone URI, click Next. Then fill in form URI: https://github.com/MichalVaclavek/wEasy, click Next. Select "db_enhancement" branch, click Next. Define your local destination Directory, click Next. Select Import Wizard (.. New Project) and click Finish. Projects will be created in your Eclipse.

After importing project from GitHub, a DB must be created. If the PostgreSQL DB is used, you can create complete DB using /scripts/postgres_script.sql file included in the source code.

Then go to src/main/resources/ and open hibernate.cfg.xml. You can edit your local (or remote) PostgreSQL DB connection here.

Then edit src/main/resources/log4j.properties file to configure app loging environment.
  
After that project should be ready to run either on Eclipse installed Tomcat 8.0 or 8.5 server or using Maven build ... goal jetty:run


## Running the tests

In Eclipse Project Explorer find src/test/java/cz.zutrasoft.mainweb.database.AllObjectsTests.java then select Run as JUnit Test on this class.

Separately you can also run TestCreateAdminUser.java in the same package as JUnit test to create a user with ADMIN role - you can choose username and password in the test's source code. The coding password can be also edited. 

## Deployment

Export project into war file and deploy using standard Tomcat manager admin page.
 
You can find http://fungisoft.cz web pages as an example of the deployed application. Application was deployed on cloud VPS server with Java 8, Tomcat 8.5 and PostgreSQL 10 installed.
